---Project Deal Finder---

The code for deal Finder, our Amazon 2018 global intern hackathon submission.
We built an Alexa skill to help you find deals! Just give Alexa a city and a category and she will find a deal that suits you. 

Note: the skill is currently hard coded with data and will not give you correct responses when asked. We will soon be having Deal Finder depend on a real deals API for data.

Code package contains:
Lambda - the endpoint that handles all the requests sent by the skill
Model - the interaction model for the skill
Skill data - the metadata for the skill
