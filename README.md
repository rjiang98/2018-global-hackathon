Amazon 2018 global intern hackathon

The code for the 2018 global intern hackathon.
We build a skill to find you the deals closest to you for anything you can think of. 
Note: the skill is hard coded with deals and will not give you real results when asked.

Code package contains:
Lambda - the endpoint that handles all the requests sent by the skill
Model - the interaction model for the skill
Skill data - the metadata for the skill
